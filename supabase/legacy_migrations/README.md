# Legacy Migrations (Archive)

This folder contains **historical Supabase migration files** from previous iterations of the project. These files are preserved for reference only and **should never be applied to the current database**.

- All active migrations are located in the `supabase/migrations/` directory.
- The current database schema starts from the new baseline migration: `supabase/migrations/20250712_baseline_schema.sql`.
- If you need to review old schema logic, RLS policies, or helper functions, consult these files here.

**Do not copy or move these files back into the active migrations directory.**
