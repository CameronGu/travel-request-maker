      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Hotel Request Form implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Basic form structure and field creation, 2) Date picker implementation with validation logic, 3) Field validation and error handling",
      "reasoning": "This form has moderate complexity with date validation, conditional fields, and tooltips. Breaking it into 3 subtasks would help organize the work around form structure, date handling, and validation logic."

      "reasoning": "This form has higher complexity than the hotel form due to multiple conditional displays (return date based on trip type and rental car section). It requires more complex validation and state management."

      "reasoning": "This form has moderate complexity with date/time validation. The main challenges are implementing proper time inputs and ensuring the drop-off date/time is after pickup date/time."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Form Reset and Data Management task into subtasks covering: 1) Clear form functionality with confirmation dialog, 2) Form data persistence during tab switching, 3) Form validation service implementation",
      "reasoning": "This task involves state management across multiple forms and requires careful handling of user data. The confirmation dialog and tab-switching persistence add complexity to what might otherwise be simple form operations."

      "reasoning": "This task requires collecting data from multiple sources, formatting it properly, implementing clipboard functionality, and handling security concerns. The Base64 encoding and XSS protection add technical complexity."

      "reasoning": "This task involves complex data encoding/decoding, URL parameter handling, and creating a separate view page. Security considerations and error handling for invalid data add significant complexity."

      "reasoning": "This is a comprehensive task that ties together all previous work and requires extensive testing across browsers and devices. Performance optimization and ensuring all components work together seamlessly make this highly complex."
