# Title: Build Summary Generation and Export System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 22, 28
# Priority: low
# Description: Create human-readable request summaries and export functionality with audit links
# Details:
Build summary generation system for submitted requests with human-readable format. Create export functionality for various formats (PDF, CSV, JSON). Implement audit trail links to Supabase rows. Add summary templates for different request types. Include batch export capabilities. Implement summary caching and optimization. Add email summary functionality for notifications.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for summary generation and formatting. Test export functionality for different formats. Verify audit trail links and data integrity. Test batch export and performance optimization.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Summary generation logic [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement core logic for generating summaries from data sources with configurable parameters and formatting options
### Details:
Develop algorithms to process raw data and generate meaningful summaries including statistical analysis, key metrics extraction, and customizable summary formats. Include support for different data types and aggregation methods.

## 2. Export to PDF/CSV/JSON [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.1
### Description: Create export functionality supporting multiple file formats with proper formatting and structure
### Details:

## 3. Audit trail links [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.1
### Description: Implement tracking and linking system for audit trails in summaries and exports
### Details:
Create a system to track data lineage, user actions, and changes throughout the summary generation process. Include timestamps, user identification, and source data references for compliance and traceability.

## 4. Summary templates [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.1
### Description: Develop customizable template system for standardized summary formats
### Details:
Create a template engine allowing users to define custom summary layouts, include/exclude specific sections, and apply consistent formatting. Support template inheritance and organization-specific branding.

## 5. Batch export and caching [pending]
### Dependencies: 29.2, 29.3, 29.4
### Description: Implement batch processing capabilities and caching mechanisms for improved performance
### Details:
Build batch export functionality for processing multiple summaries simultaneously, implement intelligent caching to reduce processing time for frequently requested summaries, and include queue management for large-scale operations.
