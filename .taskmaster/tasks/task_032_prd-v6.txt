# Task ID: 32
# Title: Setup CI/CD Pipeline with Performance Monitoring
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 31
# Priority: medium
# Description: Configure GitHub Actions CI/CD with bundle optimization and performance monitoring
# Details:
Setup GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing and deployment. Implement bundle size monitoring with 300kB limit enforcement. Add Lighthouse performance testing with â‰¥90 score requirement. Configure automated accessibility testing with axe-core. Implement code quality checks with ESLint and TypeScript. Add automated security scanning and dependency updates.

# Test Strategy:
Verify CI pipeline runs all tests successfully. Test bundle size limits and performance thresholds. Ensure automated accessibility and security checks pass. Verify deployment process works correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up GitHub Actions workflow [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions that orchestrates all quality checks, testing, and deployment processes
### Details:
Configure workflow files with proper triggers, environment variables, secrets management, and job orchestration. Set up matrix builds for different environments and implement proper error handling and notifications.

## 2. Implement bundle size monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 32.1
### Description: Integrate bundle analysis tools to track and monitor JavaScript bundle sizes across builds and prevent performance regressions
### Details:
Set up bundle analyzer tools, configure size thresholds, implement automated reporting, and create alerts for bundle size increases. Include visualization and historical tracking of bundle metrics.

## 3. Configure Lighthouse performance testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 32.1
### Description: Implement automated Lighthouse audits to measure and track web performance metrics including Core Web Vitals
### Details:
Set up Lighthouse CI integration, configure performance budgets, implement automated testing across different pages and devices, and create performance regression detection with detailed reporting.

## 4. Set up accessibility testing automation [pending]
### Dependencies: 32.1
### Description: Implement automated accessibility testing to ensure WCAG compliance and detect accessibility issues early in the development process
### Details:
Configure accessibility testing tools like axe-core, set up automated scanning for common accessibility issues, implement ARIA validation, and create comprehensive accessibility reports with remediation guidance.

## 5. Implement code quality checks [pending]
### Dependencies: 32.1
### Description: Set up comprehensive code quality analysis including linting, formatting, complexity analysis, and maintainability metrics
### Details:
Configure ESLint, Prettier, SonarQube or similar tools, set up code coverage thresholds, implement complexity analysis, and create quality gates that prevent low-quality code from being merged.

## 6. Configure security scanning and dependency updates [pending]
### Dependencies: 32.1
### Description: Implement automated security vulnerability scanning and dependency management to maintain secure and up-to-date codebase
### Details:
Set up dependency vulnerability scanning, configure automated security audits, implement dependency update automation with testing, and create security reporting with risk assessment and remediation steps.
