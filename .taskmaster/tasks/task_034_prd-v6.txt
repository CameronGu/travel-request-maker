# Task ID: 34
# Title: Optimize Bundle Size and Performance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 30, 31
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement bundle optimization, code splitting, and performance improvements
# Details:
Implement code splitting for route-based and component-based chunks. Add tree-shaking optimization to remove unused code. Implement lazy loading for non-critical components. Optimize images and assets with Next.js optimization. Add service worker for caching and offline support. Implement performance monitoring and metrics collection. Remove legacy code imports and dependencies.

# Test Strategy:
Verify bundle size stays under 300kB limit. Test code splitting and lazy loading functionality. Measure performance improvements with Lighthouse. Test offline functionality and caching behavior.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Code Splitting [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up dynamic imports and route-based code splitting to reduce initial bundle size and improve loading performance
### Details:
Configure webpack or build tool for code splitting, implement dynamic imports for routes and components, create separate chunks for vendor libraries, and set up async component loading with proper error boundaries

## 2. Configure Tree-shaking [pending]
### Dependencies: 34.1
### Description: Enable tree-shaking to eliminate dead code and unused imports from the final bundle
### Details:
Configure build tools for tree-shaking, analyze bundle composition, remove unused exports and imports, optimize library imports to use only required modules, and verify dead code elimination

## 3. Implement Lazy Loading [pending]
### Dependencies: 34.1
### Description: Set up lazy loading for components, images, and other resources to improve initial page load times
### Details:
Implement React.lazy() or similar for component lazy loading, set up intersection observer for image lazy loading, configure lazy loading for non-critical resources, and add loading states and fallbacks

## 4. Optimize Assets [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Compress and optimize images, fonts, and other static assets to reduce file sizes and improve loading speed
### Details:
Compress images using modern formats (WebP, AVIF), optimize font loading with font-display and preload, minify CSS and JavaScript, implement responsive images, and set up proper caching headers

## 5. Setup Service Worker [pending]
### Dependencies: 34.2, 34.3, 34.4
### Description: Implement service worker for caching strategies and offline functionality to improve performance and user experience
### Details:
Create service worker for asset caching, implement cache-first and network-first strategies, set up background sync, configure cache invalidation, and add offline fallback pages

## 6. Remove Legacy Code [pending]
### Dependencies: 34.2
### Description: Identify and remove outdated code, unused dependencies, and legacy browser support to reduce bundle size
### Details:
Audit codebase for unused code and dependencies, remove polyfills for unsupported browsers, clean up deprecated APIs and libraries, update build targets for modern browsers, and verify functionality after cleanup
