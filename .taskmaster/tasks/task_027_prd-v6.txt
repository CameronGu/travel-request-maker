# Task ID: 27
# Title: Implement Real-time Synchronization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 17, 19, 22
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add real-time updates using Supabase subscriptions for live data synchronization
# Details:
Create real-time hooks (useRequestsRealtime, useTravelersRealtime) using Supabase subscriptions. Implement optimistic updates with conflict resolution. Add connection status indicators and reconnection logic. Create real-time notification system for status changes. Implement proper cleanup and subscription management. Add feature flag support for real-time functionality.

# Test Strategy:
Write integration tests for real-time subscriptions and updates. Test connection handling and reconnection logic. Verify optimistic updates and conflict resolution. Test notification system and cleanup procedures.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Real-time hooks for requests [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement WebSocket hooks and state management for real-time request data updates including creation, status changes, and cancellations
### Details:
Create custom React hooks for managing real-time request data flow, handle incoming WebSocket messages for request updates, implement request state synchronization, and provide clean API for components to subscribe to request changes

## 2. Real-time hooks for travelers [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop WebSocket hooks for real-time traveler data including location updates, availability status, and profile changes
### Details:
Build custom hooks for traveler real-time data management, handle location tracking updates, manage traveler availability states, implement traveler profile synchronization, and provide subscription mechanisms for traveler-related real-time events

## 3. Optimistic update logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 27.1, 27.2
### Description: Create optimistic update system for immediate UI feedback before server confirmation with rollback capabilities
### Details:
Implement optimistic update patterns for requests and traveler actions, create rollback mechanisms for failed operations, manage temporary states during pending operations, and ensure UI consistency during network delays

## 4. Connection/reconnection handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 27.1, 27.2
### Description: Build robust WebSocket connection management with automatic reconnection, offline detection, and data synchronization
### Details:
Implement WebSocket connection lifecycle management, create automatic reconnection logic with exponential backoff, handle offline/online state detection, implement data synchronization after reconnection, and manage connection status indicators

## 5. Notification system [pending]
### Dependencies: 27.1, 27.2, 27.4
### Description: Develop real-time notification system for requests, traveler updates, and system events with proper categorization and delivery
### Details:
Create notification hooks and components, implement notification categorization and prioritization, build notification delivery mechanisms, create notification history and management, and integrate with real-time data streams

## 6. Feature flag support [pending]
### Dependencies: 27.4
### Description: Implement feature flag system for real-time features with dynamic configuration and A/B testing capabilities
### Details:
Create feature flag hooks and context providers, implement dynamic feature toggling, build A/B testing framework for real-time features, create feature flag management interface, and ensure feature flags work with real-time data flows
