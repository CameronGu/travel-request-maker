# Task ID: 35
# Title: Implement Security Hardening and Audit Logging
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 18, 23, 28
# Priority: high
# Description: Add comprehensive security measures and audit logging throughout the application
# Details:
Implement comprehensive audit logging for all user actions. Add security headers and CSRF protection. Implement rate limiting for API endpoints. Add input sanitization and validation. Create security monitoring and alerting. Implement proper error handling without information leakage. Add security testing and vulnerability scanning.

# Test Strategy:
Write security tests for authentication and authorization. Test audit logging completeness and accuracy. Verify rate limiting and input validation. Test error handling and information disclosure prevention.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Comprehensive Audit Logging [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up detailed audit logging system to track all user actions, system events, and security-related activities across the application
### Details:
Create logging infrastructure that captures user authentication, authorization attempts, data access, configuration changes, and administrative actions. Include timestamp, user ID, IP address, action type, and outcome. Implement log rotation and secure storage.

## 2. Configure Security Headers [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement and configure essential HTTP security headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities
### Details:
Set up Content Security Policy (CSP), X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS), X-XSS-Protection, and Referrer-Policy headers. Configure middleware to automatically apply these headers to all responses.

## 3. Implement CSRF Protection [pending]
### Dependencies: 35.2
### Description: Deploy Cross-Site Request Forgery protection mechanisms across all state-changing operations
### Details:
Implement CSRF tokens for all forms and AJAX requests, configure SameSite cookie attributes, validate origin headers, and set up proper token generation and validation middleware. Ensure protection covers all POST, PUT, DELETE operations.

## 4. Deploy Rate Limiting System [pending]
### Dependencies: 35.1
### Description: Implement comprehensive rate limiting to prevent abuse and protect against DoS attacks
### Details:
Set up rate limiting for API endpoints, login attempts, password reset requests, and other sensitive operations. Implement different rate limit tiers based on user roles, IP-based limiting, and distributed rate limiting for scalability. Include proper error responses and logging.

## 5. Implement Input Sanitization and Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive input validation and sanitization system to prevent injection attacks
### Details:
Implement server-side validation for all user inputs, sanitize data to prevent XSS and SQL injection, use parameterized queries, validate file uploads, and implement proper encoding/escaping. Create reusable validation middleware and schemas.

## 6. Set Up Security Monitoring and Alerting [pending]
### Dependencies: 35.1, 35.4
### Description: Deploy real-time security monitoring system with automated alerting for suspicious activities
### Details:
Create monitoring dashboards for security events, set up automated alerts for failed login attempts, unusual access patterns, rate limit violations, and potential attacks. Implement log analysis tools and integrate with incident response procedures.

## 7. Implement Robust Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 35.1
### Description: Create secure error handling system that prevents information disclosure while maintaining usability
### Details:
Implement global error handlers that log detailed errors internally while showing generic messages to users, prevent stack trace exposure, handle database errors securely, and create custom error pages. Ensure error responses don't leak sensitive information.

## 8. Conduct Security Testing and Scanning [pending]
### Dependencies: 35.2, 35.3, 35.5, 35.7
### Description: Perform comprehensive security testing including automated scanning and manual penetration testing
### Details:
Set up automated security scanning tools (SAST/DAST), conduct vulnerability assessments, perform penetration testing, implement security unit tests, and create security regression test suite. Document findings and remediation steps.
