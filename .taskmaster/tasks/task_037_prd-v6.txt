# Priority: high
# Description: Perform comprehensive end-to-end testing and performance validation before production deployment
# Details:
Conduct full end-to-end testing of all user workflows. Perform load testing to validate performance SLAs (p95 â‰¤ 100ms for duplicate detection). Test complete authentication and authorization flows. Validate all admin functions and role-based access. Test real-time functionality and data synchronization. Perform security penetration testing. Validate accessibility compliance across all components.

# Test Strategy:
Execute complete test suite including unit, integration, and e2e tests. Validate all performance benchmarks and SLAs. Verify security and accessibility compliance. Test disaster recovery and data backup procedures.

# Subtasks:
## 1. End-to-end workflow testing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Comprehensive testing of complete user workflows from start to finish, validating all integrated components work together seamlessly across different user scenarios and business processes.
### Details:
Execute full user journeys including registration, login, core feature usage, data processing, and output generation. Test cross-browser compatibility, mobile responsiveness, and integration points between frontend and backend systems.

## 2. Load/performance testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 37.1
### Description: Validate system performance under various load conditions, including peak usage scenarios, concurrent user sessions, and resource-intensive operations to ensure scalability and responsiveness.
### Details:
Conduct stress testing, load testing, and performance benchmarking. Monitor response times, throughput, resource utilization, and identify bottlenecks. Test database performance, API response times, and system stability under high load.

## 3. Auth/authorization validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 37.1
### Description: Comprehensive testing of authentication mechanisms and authorization controls to ensure proper user access management, role-based permissions, and security of protected resources.
### Details:
Test user login/logout, password policies, multi-factor authentication, session management, role-based access controls, permission inheritance, and unauthorized access prevention across all system components.

## 4. Admin function validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 37.3
### Description: Thorough testing of administrative features including user management, system configuration, monitoring capabilities, and administrative workflows to ensure proper system governance.
### Details:
Validate admin dashboard functionality, user role management, system settings configuration, audit logging, reporting features, backup/restore operations, and administrative security controls.

## 5. Real-time sync testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 37.1, 37.2
### Description: Validate real-time data synchronization across different system components, ensuring data consistency, conflict resolution, and proper handling of concurrent updates.
### Details:
Test real-time notifications, data replication, conflict resolution mechanisms, offline/online sync, multi-device synchronization, and data integrity during concurrent operations.

## 6. Security penetration testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 37.3, 37.4
### Description: Comprehensive security assessment including vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and security control validation to identify and address potential security weaknesses.
### Details:
Conduct OWASP security testing, SQL injection testing, XSS vulnerability assessment, API security validation, data encryption verification, and network security analysis.

## 7. Accessibility compliance [pending]
### Dependencies: 37.1
### Description: Validate system compliance with accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1) to ensure the application is usable by people with disabilities across different assistive technologies.
### Details:
Test screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation, color contrast ratios, alternative text for images, focus management, and compliance with ADA requirements across all user interfaces.

## 8. Disaster recovery testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 37.2, 37.4, 37.5
### Description: Validate disaster recovery procedures, backup systems, and business continuity plans to ensure system resilience and data protection in case of failures or disasters.
### Details:
Test backup and restore procedures, failover mechanisms, data recovery processes, system redundancy, recovery time objectives (RTO), recovery point objectives (RPO), and business continuity protocols.
