# Task ID: 28
# Title: Implement Request Status Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 14, 22, 24
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build complete request status tracking with state machine and audit logging
# Details:
Implement request status enum and state machine logic (draft → submitted → accepted → assigned → in_progress → completed/cancelled). Create request_status_log table with triggers for status change tracking. Build status update interface for admins with validation. Implement status-based UI rendering and permissions. Add status history viewing and audit trail. Create automated status transitions where applicable.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for status state machine and validation. Test status change triggers and audit logging. Verify status-based permissions and UI rendering. Test status history and audit functionality.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Status enum/state machine logic [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the status enumeration and state machine logic to define valid status transitions and business rules
### Details:
Create status enum definitions, implement state transition validation logic, define allowed transitions between statuses, and establish business rules for status changes

## 2. request_status_log table and triggers [pending]
### Dependencies: 28.1
### Description: Create database table for status logging and implement database triggers to automatically capture status changes
### Details:
Design request_status_log table schema, create database triggers for automatic status change logging, implement indexes for performance, and ensure data integrity constraints

## 3. Status update UI [pending]
### Dependencies: 28.1
### Description: Develop user interface components for viewing and updating request statuses with proper validation
### Details:
Create status display components, implement status update forms with validation, add visual indicators for status changes, and ensure responsive design across devices

## 4. Status-based permissions [pending]
### Dependencies: 28.1
### Description: Implement role-based access control system that restricts actions based on current request status and user permissions
### Details:
Define permission matrices for different user roles and statuses, implement authorization middleware, create permission checking functions, and integrate with existing authentication system

## 5. Status history/audit trail [pending]
### Dependencies: 28.2
### Description: Build comprehensive audit trail system to track all status changes with timestamps, user information, and change reasons
### Details:
Implement audit trail data models, create history viewing interfaces, add filtering and search capabilities, and ensure compliance with audit requirements

## 6. Automated transitions [pending]
### Dependencies: 28.1, 28.2
### Description: Develop automated status transition system based on time triggers, external events, or business conditions
### Details:
Create scheduled job system for time-based transitions, implement event-driven status changes, add configuration for automation rules, and include error handling and retry logic

## 7. Tests for all logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 28.1, 28.2, 28.3, 28.4, 28.5, 28.6
### Description: Create comprehensive test suite covering all status management functionality including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests
### Details:
Write unit tests for state machine logic, create integration tests for database operations, implement UI tests for status components, test permission scenarios, and add performance tests for audit trail queries
