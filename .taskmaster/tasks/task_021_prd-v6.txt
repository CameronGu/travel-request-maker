# Task ID: 21
# Title: Enhance TravelerModal with Duplicate Detection Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 15, 16, 18, 20
# Priority: medium
# Description: Upgrade existing TravelerModal component with Supabase integration and duplicate detection workflow
# Details:
Enhance existing TravelerModal.tsx with Supabase persistence replacing local storage. Integrate duplicate detection workflow with EXACT/STRONG/SOFT confidence levels. Implement block modal for EXACT matches, confirmation modal for STRONG matches, and toast notifications for SOFT matches. Add merge functionality for admin users. Include phone/email validation with normalization.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for duplicate detection workflow. Test modal behavior for different confidence levels. Verify admin merge functionality. Test phone/email validation and normalization integration.
