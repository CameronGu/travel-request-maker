# Task ID: 20
# Title: Enhance DynamicForm Component with Supabase Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16, 17, 19
# Priority: medium
# Description: Extend existing DynamicForm component with Supabase integration, validation, and form field specifications
# Details:
Enhance existing DynamicForm.tsx with Supabase data persistence. Integrate with form-fields/*.json specifications (v2.3.4) for hotel/flight/car forms. Add React Hook Form integration with Zod validation. Implement field-level validation with real-time feedback. Add support for conditional fields and dynamic field rendering. Integrate with duplicate detection for traveler fields.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for form rendering from JSON specs. Test validation rules and error handling. Verify Supabase integration for form data persistence. Test conditional field logic and dynamic rendering. Snapshot test form outputs.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate Supabase persistence [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up Supabase client configuration, create database tables for form data storage, and implement CRUD operations for form submissions with proper error handling and connection management.
### Details:
Configure Supabase client, design database schema for dynamic form data, implement create/read/update/delete operations, add connection pooling and error recovery mechanisms.

## 2. Connect form-fields JSON specs [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a JSON schema parser that can interpret form field specifications and dynamically generate form components based on the configuration, including field types, labels, and properties.
### Details:
Design JSON schema structure for form fields, implement parser to convert JSON specs to React components, support various field types (text, select, checkbox, etc.), handle field properties and metadata.

## 3. Add React Hook Form [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.2
### Description: Integrate React Hook Form library for efficient form state management, implement form controllers, and connect with the dynamic field generation system for optimal performance.
### Details:
Install and configure React Hook Form, create form controllers for dynamic fields, implement form state management, add form submission handling, optimize re-rendering performance.

## 4. Implement Zod validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.2, 20.3
### Description: Set up Zod schema validation that works with dynamic form fields, create validation rules based on JSON specifications, and integrate with React Hook Form for real-time validation feedback.
### Details:
Install Zod validation library, create dynamic schema generation from JSON specs, implement field-level and form-level validation, add custom validation rules, integrate with React Hook Form resolver.

## 5. Add conditional/dynamic fields [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.3, 20.4
### Description: Implement conditional field rendering based on form values, create dependency management system for fields, and add dynamic field addition/removal capabilities with proper state management.
### Details:
Create conditional logic engine, implement field dependency tracking, add dynamic field show/hide functionality, handle conditional validation, manage form state for dynamic fields.

## 6. Integrate duplicate detection [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1, 20.4
### Description: Implement duplicate detection system that checks for existing form submissions based on configurable criteria, with database queries and user feedback for potential duplicates.
### Details:
Design duplicate detection algorithms, implement database queries for duplicate checking, create configurable duplicate criteria, add user interface for duplicate warnings, handle duplicate resolution workflows.

## 7. Write tests for all features [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1, 20.2, 20.3, 20.4, 20.5, 20.6
### Description: Create comprehensive test suite covering unit tests for components, integration tests for form workflows, validation tests, and end-to-end tests for the complete form system.
### Details:
Write unit tests for form components, create integration tests for form submission workflows, test validation scenarios, add tests for conditional fields, test duplicate detection, implement E2E tests for complete user journeys.
