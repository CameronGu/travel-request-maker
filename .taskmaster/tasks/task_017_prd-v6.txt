# Task ID: 17
# Title: Setup Supabase Client and Storage Driver Architecture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Configure Supabase client with proper TypeScript types and implement storage driver abstraction for testing
# Details:
Configure Supabase client in /lib/supabase/client.ts with proper environment variables. Implement storage driver abstraction in /lib/storage.ts with LocalDriver and SupabaseDriver implementations. Add feature flag system in /config.ts to control Supabase/LocalDriver usage. Setup proper TypeScript types for database schema using Supabase CLI type generation. Implement memoization for client instances.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for storage driver abstraction. Test feature flag switching between drivers. Verify environment variable validation. Test client initialization and connection handling.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure Supabase client [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up and configure the Supabase client with proper authentication, connection settings, and environment variables for database access.
### Details:
Initialize Supabase client with API keys, configure authentication methods, set up connection pooling, and establish proper error handling for database connections.

## 2. Implement LocalDriver [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a local storage driver implementation that provides in-memory or file-based data persistence for development and testing purposes.
### Details:
Build LocalDriver class with CRUD operations, implement data serialization/deserialization, add memory management, and ensure thread safety for local data operations.

## 3. Implement SupabaseDriver [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Develop the Supabase database driver that interfaces with the configured Supabase client to perform database operations.
### Details:
Create SupabaseDriver class with database query methods, implement connection handling, add error recovery mechanisms, and optimize query performance with proper indexing strategies.

## 4. Add feature flag system [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.2, 17.3
### Description: Implement a feature flag system to dynamically switch between LocalDriver and SupabaseDriver based on configuration or runtime conditions.
### Details:
Create feature flag configuration management, implement driver selection logic, add runtime switching capabilities, and ensure seamless fallback mechanisms between drivers.

## 5. Generate TypeScript types [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.2, 17.3
### Description: Create comprehensive TypeScript type definitions for all drivers, interfaces, and data structures to ensure type safety across the system.
### Details:
Define interfaces for driver contracts, create type definitions for data models, implement generic types for driver operations, and ensure strict type checking for all database interactions.

## 6. Write tests for drivers and memoization [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.4, 17.5
### Description: Develop comprehensive test suites for both drivers, feature flag system, and memoization functionality to ensure reliability and performance.
### Details:
Create unit tests for LocalDriver and SupabaseDriver, implement integration tests for feature flag switching, add performance tests for memoization, and ensure test coverage for error scenarios and edge cases.
