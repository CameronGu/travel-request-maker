# Task ID: 33
# Title: Implement Environment Configuration and Validation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 17
# Priority: medium
# Description: Setup environment configuration with validation and feature flag management
# Details:
Create environment variable validation script (scripts/validate-env.ts). Implement feature flag system in src/config.ts with runtime switching. Add environment-specific configuration for development, staging, and production. Create configuration documentation and setup guides. Implement graceful degradation for missing features. Add configuration testing and validation.

# Test Strategy:
Write tests for environment validation and feature flag switching. Test configuration loading and validation. Verify graceful degradation works correctly. Test environment-specific behavior.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Environment Validation Script [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a comprehensive script to validate environment setup, dependencies, and configuration requirements before application startup
### Details:
Develop a validation script that checks for required environment variables, verifies system dependencies, validates database connections, and ensures all necessary services are available. Include checks for version compatibility and resource availability.

## 2. Feature Flag System [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.1
### Description: Implement a feature flag system to enable/disable features based on environment and configuration settings
### Details:
Build a feature flag management system that allows toggling features per environment, supports gradual rollouts, and provides runtime configuration changes. Include admin interface for flag management and integration with existing configuration system.

## 3. Environment-Specific Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.1
### Description: Design and implement environment-specific configuration management with proper inheritance and overrides
### Details:
Create a hierarchical configuration system supporting development, staging, and production environments. Implement configuration inheritance, environment-specific overrides, and secure handling of sensitive configuration data like API keys and database credentials.

## 4. Documentation and Setup Guides [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.2, 33.3
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation and setup guides for configuration management across different environments
### Details:
Develop detailed documentation covering configuration setup procedures, environment-specific requirements, feature flag usage, troubleshooting guides, and best practices. Include step-by-step setup instructions for each environment type.

## 5. Configuration Testing and Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.2, 33.3
### Description: Implement automated testing and validation framework for configuration management system
### Details:
Build comprehensive test suite for configuration validation, including unit tests for configuration loading, integration tests for environment-specific settings, feature flag testing, and automated validation of configuration schemas across all environments.
