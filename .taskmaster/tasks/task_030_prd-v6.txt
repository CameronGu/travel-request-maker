# Task ID: 30
# Title: Implement Claymorphism Theme and UI Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 19
# Priority: low
# Description: Apply claymorphism design system with shadcn/ui components and custom styling
# Details:
Implement claymorphism token file with color palette and design tokens. Customize shadcn/ui components with claymorphism styling. Create consistent component library with proper theming. Implement dark/light mode support with theme switching. Add responsive design patterns and mobile optimization. Create component documentation and style guide.

# Test Strategy:
Write visual regression tests for component styling. Test theme switching and responsive behavior. Verify accessibility compliance with color contrast. Test component consistency across different screen sizes.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Claymorphism token file [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a comprehensive design token file that defines all claymorphism-specific values including colors, shadows, border-radius, and spacing variables
### Details:
Define CSS custom properties or design tokens for claymorphism effects such as soft shadows, subtle gradients, rounded corners, and color palettes. Include variables for different elevation levels and surface treatments.

## 2. shadcn/ui customization [pending]
### Dependencies: 30.1
### Description: Customize shadcn/ui components to incorporate claymorphism design principles and token values
### Details:
Override default shadcn/ui component styles to apply claymorphism tokens. Modify buttons, cards, inputs, and other UI elements to use soft shadows, rounded corners, and subtle color variations consistent with claymorphism aesthetic.

## 3. Component library theming [pending]
### Dependencies: 30.1, 30.2
### Description: Apply claymorphism theming across the entire component library ensuring consistency and cohesion
### Details:
Systematically theme all components in the library using the claymorphism tokens. Ensure proper hierarchy, spacing, and visual consistency across all UI elements while maintaining accessibility standards.

## 4. Dark/light mode support [pending]
### Dependencies: 30.1, 30.3
### Description: Implement comprehensive dark and light mode variations for the claymorphism theme
### Details:
Create dark and light mode variants of all claymorphism tokens and components. Ensure proper contrast ratios, shadow adjustments, and color adaptations for both themes while maintaining the claymorphism aesthetic.

## 5. Documentation and style guide [pending]
### Dependencies: 30.1, 30.2, 30.3, 30.4
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation and style guide for the claymorphism theme implementation
### Details:
Document all design tokens, component usage guidelines, theming principles, and implementation examples. Include visual examples, code snippets, and best practices for maintaining the claymorphism design system.
