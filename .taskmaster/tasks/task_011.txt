# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Accessibility and Design System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance and implement the claymorphism design system with shadcn/ui components
# Details:
Implement claymorphism design tokens in styles/tokens.ts with semantic color system. Configure shadcn/ui components with custom theming and accessibility enhancements. Add comprehensive ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support across all components. Implement focus management for modals and complex interactions. Create semantic tokens for traveler chip states (default, warning, error) and form validation feedback.

# Test Strategy:
Run vitest-axe tests for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across all components. Test keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility. Verify color contrast ratios and focus indicators. Validate design token consistency and theme switching functionality.
