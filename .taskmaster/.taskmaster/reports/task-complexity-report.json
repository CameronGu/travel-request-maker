        "complexityScore": 8,
        "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
        "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Supabase database schema and RLS policies implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Core table creation with proper relationships, 2) RLS policy implementation for attAdmin role, 3) RLS policy implementation for clientAdmin role, 4) RLS policy implementation for requester role, 5) Integration testing for role isolation",
        "reasoning": "This task involves creating multiple complex database tables with relationships, implementing role-based security policies, and ensuring proper access control. The declarative schema approach with Supabase requires careful planning of table structures and relationships, plus comprehensive RLS policies for three different roles."

        "complexityScore": 7,
        "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
        "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Link Codec and JWE Token System implementation into: 1) Core JWE token structure and encryption implementation, 2) Link encoding function with proper expiry handling, 3) Link decoding and validation function, 4) Database lookup and verification utilities",
        "reasoning": "This task requires implementing cryptographic functions using WebCrypto and Noble Ciphers, creating a token system with proper expiry handling, and integrating with database lookups. The security implications and technical complexity of cryptographic implementations make this a high-complexity task."

        "taskTitle": "Create DynamicForm Engine with JSON-driven Rendering",
        "complexityScore": 9,
        "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
        "expansionPrompt": "Split the DynamicForm engine implementation into: 1) Core form renderer with React Hook Form integration, 2) Zod validation schema generator from JSON specs, 3) Text and select field type handlers, 4) Date and number field type handlers, 5) Traveler-selector field type handler, 6) Conditional field rendering logic",
        "reasoning": "Building a declarative form engine requires complex state management, validation logic, and conditional rendering capabilities. Supporting multiple field types and form specifications adds significant complexity, especially with the need to handle conditional fields based on form state."

        "reasoning": "This task requires building multiple complex interfaces with global data access, search capabilities, and management functions. The scope includes CRUD operations across multiple entity types and implementing the claymorphism design system, making it one of the most complex tasks."

        "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Client Admin Dashboard into: 1) Project management within client scope, 2) Traveler CRUD with client isolation, 3) Link generation for client projects, 4) Request creation and queue management, 5) Traveler import/export functionality",
        "reasoning": "While similar to the ATT Admin Dashboard, this task has reduced complexity due to the client-scoped access. However, it still requires implementing multiple management interfaces with proper RLS isolation and data handling capabilities."

        "expansionPrompt": "Split the Accessibility Testing implementation into: 1) vitest-axe setup for automated testing, 2) Component-level accessibility tests, 3) Keyboard navigation and focus management, 4) Screen reader compatibility testing",
        "reasoning": "Ensuring WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across all components requires comprehensive testing, focus management implementation, and proper ARIA attributes. The technical complexity is moderate, but the breadth of components to test and fix makes this a substantial task."
