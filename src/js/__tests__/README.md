# Test Directory Structure and Conventions

- All test files for modules in src/js/ are placed in this __tests__ directory.
- Test files follow the naming convention: <module>.test.js (e.g., main.test.js, travelerService.test.js).
- Each test file contains a describe block for the module and test cases for each exported function.
- Use Jest for all tests.
- Add new test files here for any new modules added to src/js/.
