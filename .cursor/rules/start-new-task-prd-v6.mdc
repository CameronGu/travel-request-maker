  This is not a greenfield project. PRD v6 defines the task set, but parts of the codebase may already exist. 
  Review existing code to identify what is complete, what requires refactoring, and what remains TODO. 
  Do not duplicate implemented functionality. Use Supabase MCP where relevant.

  Follow Taskmaster procedure: fetch tasks, track progress, and report status using the standard mcp. 
  Begin implementation immediately after task retrieval. Do not wait for review unless blocked by ambiguity.

  When starting a new task, call the appropriate Taskmaster API to fetch the task, mark it in progress, and begin execution immediately. 
  Do not wait for confirmation or instructions unless the task cannot proceed due to ambiguity.

  Execute the task to completion. A task is only complete when its behavior is verified by tests. 
  All code changes must be test-covered. Add or update tests to match code behavior. If testing is not possible, explain in chat and note in task Implementation Details.

  Refer to `docs/latest/prd.md` for architectural and feature details, including Lean-Pepper duplicate detection, RLS policies, and JWT claims.
