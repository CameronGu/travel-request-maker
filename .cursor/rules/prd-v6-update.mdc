  This is not a greenfield project. The PRD v6 has generated a new task set,
  but parts of the codebase may have already been implemented. Please review the current
  code to determine what is complete, what needs refactoring, and
  what is still TODO. Avoid rebuilding functionality that already exists.
  Supabase integration is partially complete â€” use the Superbase MCP where
  relevant. Refer to the PRD v6 (`docs/prd.md`) for all architectural
  and feature requirements, including Lean-Pepper duplicate detection, RLS
  policies, and JWT claims.
